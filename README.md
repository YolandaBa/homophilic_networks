# Change to Karimi Code

## üîÅ Update to `_pick_targets`: Ensuring Determinism and Reproducibility

In the original Karimi et al. model for building homophilic Barab√°si‚ÄìAlbert (BA) networks, the `_pick_targets` function selects existing nodes to connect to a new node. This is done using **preferential attachment** influenced by **homophily**.

### üß™ Original Behavior

For each edge a new node wants to add:
- A random number is drawn.
- The new node may or may not connect to a candidate, depending on whether the draw falls below that node‚Äôs *unnormalized probability*.
- If no connection is made, the process retries up to a certain limit.

**Issue**:  
- The process is non-deterministic, even with fixed seeds.
- The probability dictionary does **not** update after each successful edge addition.
- Skipped nodes distort the overall target probability distribution.

See *Iteration 1* and *Iteration 2* outputs for illustrations of this behavior.

### ‚úÖ Our Update: Normalized Sampling with Deterministic Selection

We updated `_pick_targets` to ensure:
- All `m` targets are selected without retries or failed rolls.
- Probabilities are **normalized** (sum to 1).
- A random number is drawn from \([0, 1]\) and mapped to a cumulative probability range (i.e., divide the unit interval into `len(targets)` regions).
- Each draw always selects a valid target.

This guarantees that:
- **Exactly `m` targets** are selected for each new node.
- The outcome is **fully reproducible** with a fixed RNG.
- Nodes are selected fairly based on up-to-date homophily-weighted preferential attachment.

### üìå Why This Matters

This update makes the graph generation:
- Deterministic under fixed seeds.
- Free from bias due to repeated failed attempts.
- Easier to debug, explain, and visualize.

```python
# Core change
for k in target_prob_dict_copy:
    target_prob_dict_copy[k] /= prob_sum  # Normalize
...
rand_num = rng.random()
cumsum = 0
for k in target_list_copy:
    cumsum += target_prob_dict_copy[k]
    if rand_num < cumsum:
        targets.add(k)
        ...
